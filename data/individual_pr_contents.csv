  Thanks for submitting a pull request!
  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes. Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.

  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:

  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.
  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.
  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.
  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.
  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press ""Inspect"".
  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).
  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.
  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).
  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7
- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.
- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.
- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.
- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).

<!-- Replace the `[ ]` with a `[x]` in checklists once you’ve completed each step. -->
<!-- Please create a draft PR when you haven't completed all steps yet upon creation of the PR. -->

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

- [ ] `use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi`
- [ ] ...
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does what it should
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does not do what it should not
- [ ] **Document** the thing and how it works ([Example](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/post/multi/gather/aws_keys.md))

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

ianstormtaylor/slate,ianstormtaylor,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"**Description**
A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

- [ ] Delete the package's directory.
- [ ] Add it to `notNeededPackages.json`.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### Changes:
"
influxdata/influxdb,influxdata,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"- Closes #
### Required checklist
- [ ] Sample config files updated (both `/etc` folder and `NewDemoConfig` methods) (influxdb and plutonium)
- [ ] openapi swagger.yml updated (if modified API) - link openapi PR
- [ ] Signed [CLA](https://influxdata.com/community/cla/) (if not already signed)

### Description
1-3 sentences describing the PR (or link to well written issue)

### Context
Why was this added? What value does it add? What are risks/best practices?

### Affected areas (delete section if not relevant):
List of user-visible changes. As a user, what would I need to see in docs?
Examples:
CLI commands, subcommands, and flags
API changes
Configuration (sample config blocks)

### Severity (delete section if not relevant)
 i.e., (""recommend to upgrade immediately"", ""upgrade at your leisure"", etc.)

### Note for reviewers:
Check the semantic commit type:
 - Feat: a feature with user-visible changes
 - Fix: a bug fix that we might tell a user “upgrade to get this fix for your issue”
 - Chore: version bumps, internal doc (e.g. README) changes, code comment updates, code formatting fixes… must not be user facing (except dependency version changes)
 - Build: build script changes, CI config changes, build tool updates
 - Refactor: non-user-visible refactoring
 - Check the PR title: we should be able to put this as a one-liner in the release notes

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

the github issue number.

Please ensure you are submitting **from a unique branch** in your [repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/11086#issuecomment-445506416) to master in Rapid7's.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

- [ ] Start `msfconsole`
- [ ] `use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi`
- [ ] ...
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does what it should
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does not do what it should not
- [ ] **Document** the thing and how it works ([Example](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/post/multi/gather/aws_keys.md))

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

      If it is not, then move the committed files to the git staging area,
      build the `format` target to format them, and then re-commit.
      [More information is available on the wiki](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/building/#formatting-the-code).

Here are some common things we look for:

- Common utilities within `./osquery/utils` are used where appropriate (avoid reinventions).
- Modern C++ structures and patterns are used whenever possible.
- No memory or file descriptor leaks, please check all early-return and destructors.
- No explicit casting, such as `return (int)my_var`, instead use `static_cast`.
- The minimal amount of includes are used, only include what you use.
- Comments for methods, structures, and classes follow our common patterns.
- `Status` and `LOG(N)` messages do not use punctuation or contractions.
- The code mostly looks and feels similar to the existing codebase.

## Description
<!--
Describe the what and the why of your pull request. Remember that these two
are usually a bit different. As an example, if you have made various changes

If it is a simple bug-fix, please also add a line like 'Closes #123'

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

the github issue number.

Please ensure you are submitting **from a unique branch** in your [repository](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/11086#issuecomment-445506416) to master in Rapid7's.

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

- [ ] Start `msfconsole`
- [ ] `use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi`
- [ ] ...
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does what it should
- [ ] **Verify** the thing does not do what it should not
- [ ] **Document** the thing and how it works ([Example](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/post/multi/gather/aws_keys.md))

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

    👇 Please look at the following checklist to ensure that your PR can be accepted quickly:
-->

### Code change checklist

-   [ ] Added/updated unit tests
-   [ ] Updated `/docs`. For new functionality, at least `API.md` should be updated
-   [ ] Verified that there is no significant performance drop (`yarn mobx test:performance`)

<!--
    Feel free to ask help with any of these boxes!

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

lvgl/lvgl,lvgl,pull_request_template.md,"### Description of the feature or fix

A clear and concise description of what the bug or new feature is.

### Checkpoints
- [ ] Run `code-format.py` from the scripts folder. [astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/install.html) needs to be installed.
- [ ] Update the [Documentation](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/master/docs) if needed
- [ ] Add [Examples](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/master/examples) if relevant. 
- [ ] Add [Tests](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/master/tests/README.md) if applicable.
- [ ] If you added new options to `lv_conf_template.h` run [lv_conf_internal_gen.py](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/release/v8.3/scripts/lv_conf_internal_gen.py) and update [Kconfig](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/release/v8.3/Kconfig).
 
Be sure the following conventions are followed:
- [ ] Follow the [Styling guide](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/master/docs/CODING_STYLE.md)
- [ ] Prefer `enum`s instead of macros. If inevitable to use `define`s export them with `LV_EXPORT_CONST_INT(defined_value)` right after the `define`.
- [ ] In function arguments prefer `type name[]` declaration for array parameters instead of `type * name`
- [ ] Use typed pointers instead of `void *` pointers
- [ ] Do not `malloc` into a static or global variables. Instead declare the variable in `LV_ITERATE_ROOTS` list in [`lv_gc.h`](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/blob/master/src/misc/lv_gc.h) and mark the variable with `GC_ROOT(variable)` when it's used. See a detaild description [here](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/get-started/bindings/micropython.html#memory-management).
- [ ] Widget constructor must follow the `lv_<widget_name>_create(lv_obj_t * parent)` pattern.
- [ ] Widget members function must start with `lv_<modul_name>` and should receive `lv_obj_t *` as first argument which is a pointer to widget object itself.  
- [ ] `struct`s should be used via an API and not modified directly via their elements.
- [ ] `struct` APIs should follow the widgets' conventions. That is to receive a pointer to the `struct` as the first argument, and the prefix of the `struct` name should be used as the prefix of the function name too (e.g.  `lv_disp_set_default(lv_disp_t * disp)`)
- [ ] Functions and `struct`s which are not part of the public API must begin with underscore in order to mark them as ""private"".
- [ ] Arguments must be named in H files too.
- [ ] To register and use callbacks one of the followings needs to be followed (see a detaild description [here](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/get-started/bindings/micropython.html#callbacks)): 
  - For both the registration function and the callback pass a pointer to a `struct` as the first argument. The `struct` must contain `void * user_data` field.
  - The last argument of the registration function must be `void * user_data` and the same `user_data` needs to be passed as the last argument of the callback.
  - Callback types not following these conventions should end with `xcb_t`.

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

(This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

Here are some examples of good titles:

- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font
- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error
- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster

And here's an explanation of the title format:

- ""Desktop"" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)
- ""Mobile"" for the mobile app (or ""Android"" / ""iOS"" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)
- ""CLI"" for the CLI app

If it's two platforms, separate them with commas - ""Desktop, Mobile"" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with ""All"".

If it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.

Then please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use ""Resolves #123"" for new features or improvements and ""Fixes #123"" for bug fixes.

AND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

## Verification

List the steps needed to make sure this thing works

- [ ] Start `msfconsole`

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

- [ ] [Run `npm test <package to test>`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/README.md#running-tests).

Select one of these and delete the others:

If adding a new definition:
- [ ] The package does not already provide its own types, or cannot have its `.d.ts` files generated via `--declaration`
- [ ] If this is for an npm package, match the name. If not, do not conflict with the name of an npm package.
- [ ] Create it with `dts-gen --dt`, not by basing it on an existing project.
- [ ] Represents shape of module/library [correctly](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/library-structures.html)

- [ ] `tsconfig.json` [should have](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/README.md#tsconfigjson) `noImplicitAny`, `noImplicitThis`, `strictNullChecks`, and `strictFunctionTypes` set to `true`.

If changing an existing definition:
- [ ] Provide a URL to documentation or source code which provides context for the suggested changes: <<url here>>
- [ ] If this PR brings the type definitions up to date with a new version of the JS library, update the version number in the header.

If removing a declaration:
- [ ] If a package was never on Definitely Typed, you don't need to do anything. (If you wrote a package and provided types, you don't need to register it with us.)
- [ ] Delete the package's directory.
- [ ] Add it to `notNeededPackages.json`.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

markedjs/marked,markedjs,badges.md,"**@mention the contributor:**

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

Why was this added? What value does it add? What are risks/best practices?

### Affected areas (delete section if not relevant):
List of user-visible changes. As a user, what would I need to see in docs?
Examples:
CLI commands, subcommands, and flags
API changes
Configuration (sample config blocks)

### Severity (delete section if not relevant)
 i.e., (""recommend to upgrade immediately"", ""upgrade at your leisure"", etc.)

### Note for reviewers:
Check the semantic commit type:
 - Feat: a feature with user-visible changes
 - Fix: a bug fix that we might tell a user “upgrade to get this fix for your issue”
 - Chore: version bumps, internal doc (e.g. README) changes, code comment updates, code formatting fixes… must not be user facing (except dependency version changes)
 - Build: build script changes, CI config changes, build tool updates
 - Refactor: non-user-visible refactoring
 - Check the PR title: we should be able to put this as a one-liner in the release notes

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

* 确认已经安装了阿里巴巴代码规约插件：[alibaba-java-coding-guidelines ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10046-alibaba-java-coding-guidelines)
* src/main 下面不要出现中文注释
* src/test/core && src/test/demo 下面要新增测试案例请严格参照其他的，包括注释等等什么都不要错
* 如果只是自己测试 全部加入到 src/test/temp
* 如果改动量较大（5+文件）尽量先和作者沟通，这个风险很大"

ianstormtaylor/slate,ianstormtaylor,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"**Description**
A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

<!-- Replace the `[ ]` with a `[x]` in checklists once you’ve completed each step. -->

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

ianstormtaylor/slate,ianstormtaylor,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"**Description**
A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

bevyengine/bevy,bevyengine,pull_request_template.md,"# Objective

- Describe the objective or issue this PR addresses.
- If you're fixing a specific issue, say ""Fixes #X"".

## Changelog

> This section is optional. If this was a trivial fix, or has no externally-visible impact, you can delete this section.

- What changed as a result of this PR?
- If applicable, organize changes under ""Added"", ""Changed"", or ""Fixed"" sub-headings
- Stick to one or two sentences. If more detail is needed for a particular change, consider adding it to the ""Solution"" section
  - If you can't summarize the work, your change may be unreasonably large / unrelated. Consider splitting your PR to make it easier to review and merge!

## Migration Guide

> This section is optional. If there are no breaking changes, you can delete this section.

- If this PR is a breaking change (relative to the last release of Bevy), describe how a user might need to migrate their code to support these changes
- Simply adding new functionality is not a breaking change.
- Fixing behavior that was definitely a bug, rather than a questionable design choice is not a breaking change.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

ianstormtaylor/slate,ianstormtaylor,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"**Description**
A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

First, 🌠 thank you 🌠 for taking the time to consider a contribution to Meteor!

Here are some important details to follow:

* ⏰ Your time is important
          To save your precious time, if the contribution you are making will take more
          than an hour, please make sure it has been discussed in an issue first.
          This is especially true for feature requests!
* 💡 Features
          Feature requests can be created and discussed by visiting:
          https://github.com/meteor/meteor/discussions
* 🕷 Bug fixes
          These can be created and discussed in this repository. When fixing a bug,
          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add
          tests for all new behavior.
* ✏️ Explain your pull request
          Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to what your
          pull request is meant to accomplish.  Provide 🔗 links 🔗 to associated issues!

We hope you will find this to be a positive experience!  Open source contribution can be intimidating and we hope to alleviate that pain as much as possible.  Without following these guidelines, you may be missing context that can help you succeed with your contribution, which is why we encourage discussion first.  Ultimately, there is no guarantee that we will be able to merge your pull-request, but by following these guidelines we can try to avoid disappointment.

yarnpkg/yarn,yarnpkg,PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md,"<!-- 

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg/berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https://discord.com/invite/yarnpkg
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

Here are some examples of good titles:

- Desktop: Resolves #123: Added new setting to change font
- Mobile, Desktop: Fixes #456: Fixed config screen error
- All: Resolves #777: Made synchronisation faster

And here's an explanation of the title format:

- ""Desktop"" for the Windows/macOS/Linux app (Electron app)
- ""Mobile"" for the mobile app (or ""Android"" / ""iOS"" if the pull request only applies to one of the mobile platforms)
- ""CLI"" for the CLI app

If it's two platforms, separate them with commas - ""Desktop, Mobile"" or if it's for all platforms, prefix with ""All"".

If it's not related to any platform (such as a translation, change to the documentation, etc.), simply don't add a platform.

Then please append the issue that you've addressed or fixed. Use ""Resolves #123"" for new features or improvements and ""Fixes #123"" for bug fixes.

AND PLEASE READ THE GUIDE: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public/icons/*your_scraper_name*/</code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/development/get-started/sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Change user group
- [ ] Add a badge
- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

	Preferably by citing objective examples, like PRs, Issues, and so on.

-->

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos/tree/master/test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/master/peeps/PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news/` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks/vendoring/patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https:__github.com_grafana_grafana_blob_main_CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

**What is this feature?**

[Add a brief description of what the feature or update does.]

**Why do we need this feature?**

[Add a description of the problem the feature is trying to solve.]

**Who is this feature for?**

**Special notes for your reviewer:**

Please check that:
- [ ] It works as expected from a user's perspective.
- [ ] If this is a pre-GA feature, it is behind a feature toggle.
- [ ] The docs are updated, and if this is a [notable improvement](https:__grafana.com_docs_writers-toolkit_writing-guide_contribute-release-notes_#how-to-determine-if-content-belongs-in-a-whats-new-document), it's added to our [What's New](https:__grafana.com_docs_writers-toolkit_writing-guide_contribute-release-notes_) doc.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https:__github.com_atlassian_changesets_blob_master_docs_adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https:__github.com_grafana_grafana_blob_main_CONTRIBUTING.md

2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.

4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's ""Draft PR"" feature and mark it as such.

5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.

6. Name your PR as ""<FeatureArea>: Describe your change"", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the ""add to changelog"" label.

7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.

          please _try_ to add a test which verifies the fix.  If you cannot, you should
          still submit the PR but we may still ask you (and help you!) to create a test.
* 📖 Contribution guidelines
          Always follow https:__github.com_meteor_meteor_blob_master_CONTRIBUTING.md
          when submitting a pull request.  Make sure existing tests still pass, and add

  Important note: This repository is about Yarn 1.x, also called ""Classic"". We now release
  modern versions on the yarnpkg_berry repository, which has a completely new (and more
  stable) codebase.
  
  If you get a problem with Yarn 1.x, it is *very* likely to have been fixed in recent
  versions. We recommand that you migrate when you get the chance: the process has been
  refined over the years and should be mostly painless - check here for details:
  
    https:__yarnpkg.com_getting-started_migration#why-should-you-migrate
  
  If you hit blockers that aren't addressed in this guide, feel free to ask for help on
  our Discord community server, or our GitHub discussion forum:
  
    https:__discord.com_invite_yarnpkg
    https:__github.com_yarnpkg_berry_discussions

  Finally, if you intend to open a bug on modern versions of Yarn, the right tracker is here:
  
    https:__github.com_yarnpkg_berry

  If you decide to stay on Yarn 1 regardless, please be aware that we don't plan to
  merge pull requests or release future versions of Classic unless it's to solve an
  critical vulnerability report (which is unlikely). The modern releases are
  however very actively supported, and your help would be appreciated.

  Thanks for your understanding!

<!-- SECTION A - Adding a new scraper -->
<!-- See https:__github.com_freeCodeCamp_devdocs_blob_main_.github_CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-new-documentations -->

If you’re adding a new scraper, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Tested the scraper on a local copy of DevDocs
- [ ] Ensured that the docs are styled similarly to other docs on DevDocs
<!-- If the docs don’t have an icon, delete the next four items: -->
- [ ] Added these files to the <code>public_icons_*your_scraper_name*_<_code> directory:
  - [ ] `16.png`: a 16×16 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `16@2x.png`: a 32×32 pixel icon for the doc
  - [ ] `SOURCE`: A text file containing the URL to the page the image can be found on or the URL of the original image itself

<!-- SECTION B - Updating an existing documentation to its latest version -->
<!-- See https:__github.com_freeCodeCamp_devdocs_blob_main_.github_CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-existing-documentations -->

If you're updating existing documentation to its latest version, please ensure that you have:

- [ ] Updated the versions and releases in the scraper file
- [ ] Ensured the license is up-to-date and that the documentation's entry in the array in `about_tmpl.coffee` matches its data in `self.attribution`
- [ ] Ensured the icons and the `SOURCE` file in <code>public_icons_*your_scraper_name*_<_code> are up-to-date if the documentation has a custom icon
- [ ] Ensured `self.links` contains up-to-date urls if `self.links` is defined
- [ ] Tested the changes locally to ensure:
  - The scraper still works without errors
  - The scraped documentation still looks consistent with the rest of DevDocs
  - The categorization of entries is still good

If you are opening a PR for a new module that exploits a **specific** piece of hardware or requires a **complex or hard-to-find** testing environment, we recommend that you send us a demo of your module executing correctly. Seeing your module in action will help us review your PR faster!

Specific Hardware Examples:
* Switches
* Routers
* IP Cameras
* IoT devices

Complex Software Examples:
* Expensive proprietary software
* Software with an extensive installation process
* Software that requires exploit testing across multiple significantly different versions
* Software without an English language UI

We will also accept demonstrations of successful module execution even if your module doesn't meet the above conditions. It's not a necessity, but it may help us land your module faster!

Demonstration of successful module execution can take the form of a packet capture (pcap) or a screen recording. You can send pcaps and recordings to [msfdev@metasploit.com](mailto:msfdev@metasploit.com). Please include a CVE number in the subject header (if applicable), and a link to your PR in the email body.
If you wish to sanitize your pcap, please see the [wiki](https:__docs.metasploit.com_docs_development_get-started_sanitizing-pcaps.html).

## Recommendation to:

- [ ] Remove a badge

<!--

	Explain your reasoning behind tagging that person.

## As the one mentioned, I would like to:

- [ ] accept the recommendation; or,
- [ ] graciously decline; or,
- [ ] dispute the recommendation

within 30 days, if you have not indicated which option you are taking one of the following will happen:

1. If adding a badge, we will assume you are graciously declining.
2. If removing a badge, we will assume you do not want to dispute the recommendation; therefore, the badge will be removed.

<!--

	Why would someone not accept a badge? Loads of reasons depending on the circumstances.

	1. If you're a committer and someone puts a badge for you on having decision making authority in an area, do you really a) think you earned it and b) think you can do that *and* all the other stuff you got going as a committer, admin, or publisher (not to even mention your outside life)? Maybe not. And that's okay. Thank them for the recognition, explain you aren't able to take more on at the moment. It's cool to get recognized though.
	2. Maybe you don't feel you actually earned it yet. I remember being in an interview once. The interviewer asked me to give an example of going above and beyond the call of duty. I said, ""That's hard. Because what you consider going above and beyond may be what I consider to be 'just rising to'. If we're in battle and you get wounded and I pull you out of the frey before heading back into it, I don't consider that going above and beyond; I consider that rising to.""

	Why would someone remove their own badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe you got a lot going on right now and want to broadcast to the Marked community that, ""Hey, I don't want to say I'm going to do this unless I can really commit to it right now in a way that serves the project well."" That's awesome! That takes courage! Because a) saying ""no"" is hard for most humans (""people pleasers"") and b) the alternative, well, for those of us here since about October of 2017 (and prior), we know what the alternative can look like.
	2. Maybe you just think you've done all you can to help and learned all you can from the experience. Again, very awesome and courageous. It takes courage to know when to walk away on your own accord.

	Why would you want to remove someone's badge? Loads of reasons...

	1. Maybe they have decision making authority on something. You asked for their advice. And, you ended up waiting almost a month before receiving a response.
	2. Maybe it was relevant at the time (Master of Marked, for example) but you think they've lost their former level of skill (fell out of practice, for example). They could always get it back.
	3. Maybe to signal to them that, ""Hey, you seem to have forgotten about us. Are you still around (or alive)?""

	Anyway, you get the idea. This isn't about good or bad...it's just about giving the community a simple game mechanic by which to publicly say, ""Thank you"" or ""Here's what my status is"" in the community or ""Hey, I think something's wrong here"" in a civil manner.

A clear and concise description of what this pull request solves. (Please do not just link to a long issue thread. Instead include a clear description here or your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Issue**
Fixes: (link to issue)

**Example**
A GIF or video showing the old and new behaviors after this pull request is merged. Or a code sample showing the usage of a new API. (If you don't include this, your pull request will not be reviewed as quickly, because it's much too hard to figure out exactly what is going wrong, and it makes maintenance much harder.)

**Context**
If your change is non-trivial, please include a description of how the new logic works, and why you decided to solve it the way you did. (This is incredibly helpful so that reviewers don't have to guess your intentions based on the code, and without it your pull request will likely not be reviewed as quickly.)

**Checks**
- [ ] The new code matches the existing patterns and styles.
- [ ] The tests pass with `yarn test`.
- [ ] The linter passes with `yarn lint`. (Fix errors with `yarn fix`.)
- [ ] The relevant examples still work. (Run examples with `yarn start`.)
- [ ] You've [added a changeset](https:__github.com_atlassian_changesets_blob_master_docs_adding-a-changeset.md) if changing functionality. (Add one with `yarn changeset add`.)

## Verifying this change

XXXX

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:

* [ ] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.
* [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
* [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
* [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https:__github.com_alibaba_nacos_tree_master_test).
* [ ] Run `mvn -B clean package apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs -Dmaven.test.skip=true` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.

### The issue

What is the thing you want to fix? Is it associated with an issue on GitHub? Please mention it.

Always consider opening an issue first to describe your problem, so we can discuss what is the best way to amend it.  Note that if you do not describe the goal of this change or link to a related issue, the maintainers may close the PR without further review.

If your pull request makes a non-insignificant change to Pipenv, such as the user interface or intended functionality, please file a PEEP.

    https:__github.com_pypa_pipenv_blob_master_peeps_PEEP-000.md

### The fix

How does this pull request fix your problem? Did you consider any alternatives? Why is this the *best* solution, in your opinion?


### The checklist

* [ ] Associated issue
* [ ] A news fragment in the `news_` directory to describe this fix with the extension `.bugfix.rst`, `.feature.rst`, `.behavior.rst`, `.doc.rst`. `.vendor.rst`. or `.trivial.rst` (this will appear in the release changelog). Use semantic line breaks and name the file after the issue number or the PR #.

<!--
### If this is a patch to the `vendor` directory...

Please try to refrain from submitting patches directly to `vendor` or `patched`, but raise your issue to the upstream project instead, and inform Pipenv to upgrade when the upstream project accepts the fix.

A pull request to upgrade vendor packages is strongly discouraged, unless there is a very good reason (e.g. you need to test Pipenv’s integration to a new vendor feature). Pipenv audits and performs vendor upgrades regularly, generally before a new release is about to drop.

If your patch is not or cannot be accepted by upstream, but is essential to Pipenv (make sure to discuss this with maintainers!), please remember to attach a patch file in `tasks_vendoring_patched`, so this divergence from upstream can be recorded and replayed afterwards.
